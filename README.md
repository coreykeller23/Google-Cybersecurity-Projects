# Google-Cybersecurity-Projects
Hello all,

This is my repository that reflects all of the projects and problems that I solved while pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. There are many projects here that show my skills in incident response, risk analysis and assessment, access control management, and ticket response.

For any hiring managers, I hope to discuss some of the skills that my projects have taught me and how I have furthered them beyond just these.
